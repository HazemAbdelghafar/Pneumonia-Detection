# Pneumonia-Detection

## What is Pneumonia?

Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli. Symptoms typically include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. The severity of the condition is variable. Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications, or conditions such as autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, and a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired, such as community- or hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated pneumonia.

## Description of the Pneumonia Dataset

The dataset that will be used is the [Chest X-ray images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/) dataset. The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). The train folder is divided into 1341 images labeled as "Normal" and 3875 images labeled as "Pneumonia". Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, Guangzhou. For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low-quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.

## Data Augmentation

Due to the imbalance in the training dataset, data augmentation techniques will be used to increase the number of "Normal" labeled images. This is done to avoid overfitting of the model.
